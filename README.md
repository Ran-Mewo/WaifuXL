# Notice

This is a version of WaifuXL that has been modified to run as a cog, specifically for [replicate](https://replicate.com/ran-mewo/waifuxl)

WaifuXL is a state of the art super resolution model trained on ~1,200,000 anime style images from the [Danbooru2021](https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2021) dataset. You can find it online at https://waifuxl.com/. Note that while you _can_ upscale natural (real) images, the model was only trained on anime style drawings, so dont expect to have your socks blown off.

# Comparison to Waifu2x

In general, the [Real-ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10833) will outperform the models used on [waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/) by a significant margin, without the need for multiple models trained on various noise reduction levels.

I'd really suggest you check out the WaifuXL project [here](https://github.com/TheFutureGadgetsLab/WaifuXL) for more information.\
You can even run the model locally in your [browser](https://waifuxl.com)!

This is mainly a project to run the model in a GPU environment. It could serve as a baseline on how to run WaifuXL locally in a GPU environment.
